//Virtual function
//A virtual function is used to override/replace the base class function implementation
//If a object (derived) is created using base class pointer then it will call base class functio not derived class 
//function though it has the implementation

//bUT suppose we dont want base class function and and need derived class implementation only, then we will need 
//to make that function virtual in base class using virtual keyword
//pure virtual function = > if we initialise a virtual function with zero then it is called pure virtual function. A class that 
//has atleast one pure virtual function is called abstract class.
//pure virtual function has no body is base class and we MUST provide implementation in the derived class.

//Now lets make the above function as vitual
class Emp{
    private:
        int a;
    public:
        virtual void Print(){
            cout<<"Base class Print() fun";
        }
    
};

class SDE: public Emp{
    public:
        void Print(){
            cout<<"Derived SDE class Print() fun";
        }

class HR : public Emp{

int main()
{
    Emp *ptr = new SDE(); // derived class object is created using base class pointer
    ptr->Print(); // op : Derived SDE class Print() fun
    
    HR *hr  = new HR();
    hr->Print(); // Derived HR class Print() fun //does not maater virtual or not it will always implement derived class function since it is being created uing own pointer not base class pinter 
}

//Prcatical example of why we need virtual function
//Soppose we have a class Emp which has function RaisedSalary() which raised the salary by 5 %.
//We have other class SDE, HR , IT inherited from Emp.
//we want SDE salary to increase by 10 % so we cant use Emp's RaiseSalary() method but we want other base class method as it is
//so we can make the RaiseSalary() method of base class as Virtual and create an SDE object using base class Emp pointers.
//now SDE object will call RaiseSalary() method of its own not base class implementation and other method will be called from base class only since not virtual
